/**
 * Loads a map file into an array allocated dynamically to store it.
 * The function must allocate space using malloc/realloc and load
 * the map file contents into it.  The return value is the pointer
 * to the allocated and populated memory, and the height/width values
 * that are returned via the map_height/map_width pass-by-reference
 * parameters.
 *
 * The function can assume that the parameters are valid pointers, but
 * it should not assume that the file exists.  The map file format
 * is #__#__# ... __# where the # are symbols and _ represent whitespace
 * which should be ignored.  That is, the function can assume that
 * symbols are each separated by two spaces.  The function MAY NOT
 * assume that the map is a specific size; it must properly load any
 * size map in the correct format.  It can assume that the only valid
 * symbols are PLAYER, MINOTAUR, WALL, and EMPTY as defined in
 * defines.h.  The function can assume that the map is a rectangle with
 * boundary walls around the map perimeter.
 *
 * On error, the function should return NULL and should not write to
 * map_height or map_width.
 *
 * For example, if the map file contains the map:
 * W  W  W  W  W
 * W  P        W
 * W        M  W
 * W  W  W  W  W
 * Then the function should return a dynamically allocated array:
 * {'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'P', ' ', ' ', 'W', 'W', ' ', ' ', 'M', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W', 'W'}
 * and set *map_height = 4, *map_width = 5.
 *
 * @param filename A string containing the map file name to read
 * @param map_height A pointer to where the map height should be stored
 * @param map_width A pointer to where the map width should be stored
 * @return A pointer to the loaded map, or NULL on error
