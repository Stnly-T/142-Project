 * Checks if the Minotaur can see the player, and in what direction it must

 * This function should use the passed coordinates of player and the
 * Minotaur to see if the Minotaur can see the player by looking in a straight
 * line without looking through a wall.  The function can assume that
 * the global map / height / width are valid.
 *
 * If the Minotaur can the see player without looking through a wall, the
 * function should return the direction that the Minotaur must look to see
 * them (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) as defined in defines.h.  If the Minotaur has
 * caught the player, the function should return CAUGHT_PLAYER.  If
 * the Minotaur cannot see the player, the function should return SEES_NOTHING.

/**
 * Try to move the character at the given coordinates, respecting walls.
 * This function is passed the coordinates of the character.  The function
 * also takes a direction that the character should move (UP, DOWN, LEFT,
 * RIGHT) defined in defines.h.
 * The coordinates are passed by reference so that they can be updated
 * by the function, while the return of the function is a status code.
 *
 * If the move is valid, the function must update map to move the character.
 * The old location of the character must be replaced by EMPTY and the new
 * location must be updated to hold the symbol (either PLAYER or MINOTAUR)
 * given in the character parameter.
 *
 * If the character cannot move because it would run into a wall, the
 * function should return MOVED_WALL and not update the map or the
 * coordinate pointers.  If the direction that was passed was not a
 * valid direction, the function should return MOVED_INVALID_DIRECTION.
 * If the function successfully moves the character, it should return
 * MOVED_OKAY.
 *
 * Preconditions: y and x must not be NULL
 * Postconditions: If the move is valid, y and x will be updated with
 *   the new coordinates, map will be updated at the old location with EMPTY,
 *   and the the new location will be filled with the symbol in character. Returns MOVED_OKAY.
 *   If the move is invalid, none of those updates will occur and the
 *   function will return the appropriate status code: MOVED_WALL or
 *   MOVED_INVALID_DIRECTION.
 *
 * @param y A pointer to the Y position of the character to move
 * @param x A pointer to the X position of the character to move
 * @param direction The direction to try to move
 * @param character The character to move (either PLAYER or MINOTAUR)

 * symbol. The function should return the MOVED_WALL status code when this occurs.
